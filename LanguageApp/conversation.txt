Hi there. Do you have a table for 2?
Good evening. Do you have a reservation with us?
I'm sorry I don't. 
I'm afraid we're very busy tonight so there are no free tables. Would you like to wait or come back later?
How long is the wait for a table? I am very hungry. 
It is about one hour. I'm sorry about that. Would you like to order your food for takeaway instead? 
Yes please. I will have two burgers and two portions of fries. Oh and two large drinks. Thank you very much.
No problem. Your food should be here soon. Have a nice evening!
You too.
